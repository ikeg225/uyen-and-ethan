            It seems like you're going through a little ripple right now. With the kareena stuff, math midterm, and us. But that's ok. I'll always be here for you right by your side, thick and thin. I know there’s a lot on your mind and stressed with so much stuff going on. But that's ok. You'll figure it out and in a year this'll all be behind you. I know you don't feel as loved as you should be by me. And that's not ok. I'm sorry that shouldn't still be a thing. I do love you uyen, so very much. You really are my other half. I want to spend a long time with you and experience so much more with you. There’s just so much going on in school, or recruiting that I just get caught up in it all so easily and don't show my appreciation for you. You do so much for me - boost my happiness, confidence, energy. I literally wouldn't be here if it weren't for you always being by my side and cheering me along. I feel so loved by you. And I want you to know that I love you way more than you love me (not a competition but it’s true). You have and still are a crazy dream to me and I would never let you go. I just hope I can make you feel loved. That's the bare minimum I should do for everything you've done for me. I hope you feel better tomorrow.\n
            Love,\n
