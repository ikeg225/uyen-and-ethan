            I feel like these past few weeks has been a rollercoaster. So much happening - your birthday, planning out Open Project late into the night, dying your hair red, interview after interview, landing BI then Justworks. There’s always something fun and new happening with you. So many things you’re doing and working on. Watching you lead the Open Project welcome event with so much passion and energy. Wow you’re so cool and amazing to watch. I’m so lucky to be able to call you my girlfriend. I love you so much. I hope we will always have so much love for each other. And be together for a long long time.\n
            Love you always,
            Ethan\n
            PS plz accept my valentines, I'm so lonely.`}
