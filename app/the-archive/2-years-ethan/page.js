            Wow… its been 2 years already?? Time flies for real. I still remember when we were still getting to know each other. When I was driving you around that first summer. When I asked you about dating on the beach. I remember it was so dark you could hardly see, and the ocean was pitch black. Fast forward to that ice cream store… was it a yogurt land? I don’t exactly remember, all I know is I asked you out for real! And you said you’d think about it, and when we got back to the car you said “YES” and pulled me in and kissed me hahaha. Damn that was definitely the start of something amazing - so many memories, so many experiences together throughout the years. How much we’ve grown as individuals and as a couple. From not knowing what we want to do as a career, to landing amazing internships and setting ourselves up for success. From experiencing shitty stuff like kareena or other frustrating people along the way, to learning from those people and understanding how we’d handle it again in the future. We’ve watched each other change so much, especially during a volatile time like college. \n
            As we are getting closer to the end of college, honestly, the future scares me. I’m not sure where either of us will end up and what we’ll be doing. Our careers and aspirations could take us anywhere. But if there’s anything I learned from you, it’s to live in the moment. Be present and take it all in. Enjoy every single second of it and be happy. I’ll spend every single second I can with you uyen to be happy and make as many memories as I can with you and to cherish it forever. I can’t wait for the future memories I make with you and all the smiles, laughs, and giggles we’ll have together. \n
            Love you forever,\n
            Ethan`}
