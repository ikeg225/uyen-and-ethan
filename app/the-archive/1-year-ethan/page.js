            Thank you for the past year. To be honest I’m not too sure what I want to write. I can thank you for the amazing memories we’ve made the past year, like my first kiss with you. Or reminisce on the different experiences we’ve had together, like talking to the poet Gerald Marchewka about his life. Or maybe the lessons that you’ve taught me, like encouraging me to do things out of my comfort zone, and how much I’ve grown with you as a human being.\n
            But I think I just want to say this - thank you. You are the love of my life. You are my everything. You are what I think about 90% of my day. You are the person I go to when I’m sad, when I’m mad, or when I’m happy. You make me enjoy wherever I am and whatever I’m doing. You are the sunshine in my life. So thank you. Thank you for being with my and letting me spend countless hours with you and be the happiest person in the world.\n
            I hope we can spend much, much more time with one another. I am looking forward to it!\n
            Love,\n
            Ethan `}
