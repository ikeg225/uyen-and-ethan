            Thank you for making this summer special and so memorable. In the beginning of the summer I didn’t know how it would go. I was afraid we wouldn’t be able to make it work and we’d be strangers once again. But I’m glad we stuck through it because I can’t imagine how my summer would’ve been if it weren’t for you (probably boring, uneventful, sitting at home and doing mundane things). We only saw each other once a week but despite the limited time we had with each other, I feel like we’ve connected with one another on such a deep level. I’ve gotten to know you so much more and learned some interesting things about you like how you don’t like taking the first bite of food so you have the other person bite first to make sure it’s not poisonous. I learned about your food likes and dislikes, like how you like to drink green tea with lemon and honey when you’re sick as well as general likes such as we bear bares or Steven universe or day6 or your favorite color/number. I learned about more personal topics about you like your upbringing and how you came to be the person you are today. I even got to learn about your random interesting facts of the day like how if you burn your finger, you should touch your ear because it’ll hurt less (I still don’t know if this is even true??). \n
            To me, summer was just a teaser for what’s to come at Berkeley and I’m excited to see what our next chapter entails. Can’t wait to see you again soon!\n
            Love,\n
            Ethan`}
